    "### What is our dataset about?\n",
    "\n",
    "The NTSB aviation accident database contains information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its territories, and possessions, and in international waters. \n",
    "\n",
    "A preliminary report is available online within a few days of an accident. Information is added when available, and when the investigation is completed, the preliminary report is replaced with a final description of the accident and its probable cause. The dataset is updated monthly in Microsoft Access 2000 MDB format. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we decided to use a version of the dataset only including incidents from 2008 to the Present. Our decision for this was largely because the datasets before 2008 did not distinguish whether the event represented the pilot controlling the aircraft at the time or whether the event index was associate with co-pilots, crew, or passengers’ injuries or related statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "To appropriately address our research question and reduce our sample size from over 100,000 events to around 8000. The dataset was originally cleaned via Excel in the Microsoft Access 2000 MDB format. From there we selected the appropriate variables and compiled them into a single Excel file where we were able to remove repeats, and null values. Finally, we saved this subset of the original Microsoft Access Database in a CSV format.\n"

    "\n",
    "Research Question: Is it possible to develop an accurate classifier that determines severity of injury for fixed wing aircraft incidents?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we hope to create a model that can classify injury level based upon pilot age (measured in years), and experience (measured in flight hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that flight hours are measured by the number of hours a pilot has been operating an aircraft, which is kept in a log and verified in annual inspections by a third party to ensure the airworthiness of the vehicle, along with its pilot. Further hours may be logged while completing training exercises as a co-pilot or with guided instruction for a CFI (Certified Flight Instructor.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Time logged in simulators or ground school are not included in pilot flight hours. In this study we are looking to use an industry standard classifier (the SVM) to help predict pilot crash severity. The four classifiers we will be using are Logistric Regression, SVM SVC, SVM SVC Linear Regression, and a Gradient Descent/Hinge Loss function without using libraries."

    "We expect our model to perform better than a random chance algorithm, that is 51% or better. We do not expect there to be a large difference in the implementations, however we do believe that our dataset is not perfect. For future research, it could be useful to compare other models and include more features. Adding more features may improve the accuracy of our models, avoiding blatant representations such as engine failure, severe weather conditions, or drug/alcohol use."

Furthermore, there are limited amounts of features that we used to develop our classifier. Looking into the NTSB Aviation Accident Database and picking more correlating features may help to improve our model. Additionally, many of the outliers in our data are present due to deciding to keep both private and commercial flight data in our dataset. Splitting these data groups up may also help to improve our model. "
