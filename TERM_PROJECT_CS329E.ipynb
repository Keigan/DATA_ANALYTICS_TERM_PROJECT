    "\n",
    "The NTSB aviation accident database contains information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its territories, and possessions, and in international waters. \n",
    "\n",
    "A preliminary report is available online within a few days of an accident. Information is added when available, and when the investigation is completed, the preliminary report is replaced with a final description of the accident and its probable cause. The dataset is updated monthly in Microsoft Access 2000 MDB format. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we decided to use a version of the dataset only including incidents from 2008 to the Present. Our decision for this was largely because the datasets before 2008 did not distinguish whether the event represented the pilot controlling the aircraft at the time or whether the event index was associate with co-pilots, crew, or passengers’ injuries or related statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "To appropriately address our research question and reduce our sample size from over 100,000 events to around 8000. The dataset was originally cleaned via Excel in the Microsoft Access 2000 MDB format. From there we selected the appropriate variables and compiled them into a single Excel file where we were able to remove repeats, and null values. Finally, we saved this subset of the original Microsoft Access Database in a CSV format.\n"

    "Research Question: Are young inexperienced pilots more likely to cause from fatal or severe injury in fixed wing general aviation aircraft incidents as oppsed to there older more experienced counter parts?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the study we hope to create a model that can classify injury level based upon pilot age, measured in years of age, and experienced, measured in hours actively piloting an aircraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that flight hours are measured by the number of hours a plane has been operating an aircraft, which is kept in a log and verified in annual inspections by a third party in part to ensure the airworthiness of the vehicle, as well as its pilot. Further hours may be logged while completing training exercises as a co-pilot or with guided instruction for a CFI (Certified Flight Instructor.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Time logged in simulators or ground school are not included in pilot flight hours. In this study we are looking to use an industry standard classifier called an SVM to help predict pilot crash severity. The three classifiers we will be using are SVM using Sci-kit Learn, SVM SVC Linear Regression, and a Gradient Descent and Hinge Loss function without using libraries."

    "\n",
    "We expect the model to do better than random chance, that is 51% or better. I do not expect there to be a large difference in the implementations, however I do believe the data is not perfect so for future research it would be important to compare models that have the highest probability of predicting outcomes as well as including more features that will improve odds of correctness without blatantly representing outcomes such as engine failure, severe weather conditions, or drug / alcohol use."
